### Introduction
A brief introduction that includes the movie's title, director, main actors, genre, and release date. I also provide background information about the film or mention any significant context that might be relevant. I sometimes include other information about the specific genre or anything else that comes to mind. *I also try to include specific elements I liked...*

### Summary
I then give a brief summary of the movie's plot. I delve into the central storyline, and go over the all steps of the story including the end quickly to give an idea of what the movie is about and set the stage for the analysis.

### Analysis
I then delve into the actual review where I explore my thoughts and opinions about the movie. **Such as,**

- Acting: Discuss the performances of the actors. Were they convincing in their roles? What do they represent? Do they evolve?
- Writing: Assess the screenplay. Was the dialogue engaging? Did the story flow well?
- Cinematography: Comment on the visuals, including the use of camera angles, lighting, and set design. How does it compliment the rest of the show?
- Soundtrack: Discuss the music and sound effects. Did they enhance the viewing experience? How does the music depict the ambiance?
- Themes and messages: Explore the themes explored in the movie and whether they were effectively conveyed. How do they explore more global ideas about society? Do they fit in with the genre? Why?
- Pacing: Consider the movie's pacing. Did it keep you engaged throughout, or did it drag at certain points? How could it have been better?
- Originality: Evaluate the movie's originality and whether it brought something new to the table. What made it different? How was this difference directed?

### Conclusion
I Wrap up the review by summarizing my overall thoughts on the movie. I then add any final comments I have or feelings such as for a sequel, a character I've appreciated, etc.

Most importantly, remember that a movie review is ultimately your opinion, so feel free to express your thoughts and feelings about the film.
