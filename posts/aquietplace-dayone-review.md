### Introduction
Simple words. Simple ideas. Simple objectives. A Quiet Place: Day One, an original thriller, recounts the first instances of a devastating alien attack on the world which forces New York City into silence. This gripping twist makes for an odd but interesting movie, with only a few words of dialogue, constant fast paced suspense, and a small and easily scared but likeable cat, named Frodo.

### Summary [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place:_Day_One)
Samira, a terminally ill cancer patient, lives at a hospice outside New York City with her cat, Frodo. One day, Reuben, a care worker, convinces a reluctant Sam to join a group outing to a marionette show in Manhattan. During the trip, the group notices meteor-like objects crashing into the city. Shortly afterward, hostile extraterrestrial creatures begin to attack people. In the ensuing chaos, Sam is knocked unconscious.

Sam later wakes up inside the puppet theater with Frodo and other survivors. Everyone is quiet, and she is signaled by fellow survivor Henri to avoid making any noise. Announcements from overhead military helicopters warn civilians to stay silent and hidden until rescues can be made. Sam witnesses the bridges leading out of Manhattan being bombed, to prevent the creatures from leaving the island. One of the survivors begins to panic, which causes Henri to accidentally kill him in the process of keeping him silent.

Later that night, the national power grid cuts out, causing the building's backup generator to noisily activate. Reuben turns it off, but the noise attracts a creature that kills him. A distraught Sam takes Frodo and leaves for Harlem. The military announces it is preparing to evacuate civilians by boat from South Street Seaport, because the creatures are unable to swim. Groups of people start leaving buildings towards the evacuation point, but the sheer volume of their movement together in crowds creates noise that alerts the creatures, who attack them and cause a stampede. Sam flees in the opposite direction and is separated from Frodo.

Eric, an English law student, escapes a flooded subway station and encounters Frodo, following him back to Sam. She attempts to convince Eric to go to the evacuation point, but Eric is shell-shocked and follows Sam back to her apartment instead, where she hopes to find pain medication. While there, Eric learns Sam is an acclaimed and published poet. Sam and Eric later agree to travel together and narrowly avoid the creatures as they make their way to Harlem. Along the way, Eric gets Sam's medication for her from a nearby pharmacy, and when trying to collect Frodo on the way back, discovers a group of creatures led by a larger one feeding on organic "eggs" from the asteroids. Sam tells him that, as a child, she used to watch her late father play jazz at a club and would get pizza with him at Patsy's afterward, something Sam always wanted to do before she died. Eric fulfills Sam's wish by taking her to the club, collecting pizza from another store, and performing a magic card trick to cheer her up.

Later, Eric and Sam see boats in the river, filled with survivors escaping Manhattan. As the two leave together, creatures start to congregate along the shore. Sam gives Frodo to Eric and runs off to distract the creatures by smashing car windows, while Eric jumps into the water and is pulled up into a boat by Henri. He then finds a note in his jacket from Sam, telling him to take care of Frodo and thanking Eric for reminding her to live.

Sometime later, Sam walks into an empty street as she listens to Nina Simone's recording of "Feeling Good" on her iPod. Accepting her imminent fate, Sam smiles as she unplugs the earphones and lets the music blare just as a creature appears behind her.

### A spark of humanity in a dark dystopian world
The first aspect I want to explore in this movie, is the dichotomy between the remnants of humanity and the lack of such. The setting in which this situation takes place is not one which encourages collaboration and even less social interaction, including acts of kindness. In a world where speech, can send someone to their peril, taking such risk is often set aside. Why would you give someone what little food you have, when you don't know when you'll find more? Why should you let someone accompany you when you don't even know them? They could get scared and let out a scream... Why would you take someone home, when they could steal the only things you have left? Humanity is my answer to all of these if you're wondering. In the movie, Samira succumbs to Erics' pleas, allowing him to follow her and even risking her life at the end for him. She could've just saved herself but instead she put herself at risk by distracting the creatures, giving small but crucial seconds for Eric to escape. One could argue that due to her deteriorating physical abilities her life was meaningless. But I would argue the opposite. She knows how little time she has left but instead she decides to give up that time to save a man she's known for only a few hours, and gives up her most precious possesion her cat to that man. Throughout the movie, death also takes its toll taking away seemingly foundational characters to the story. While their deaths serve their purpose, the reason for these does also. An example of this, is the act of selflessness Reuben commits. By rushing to turn off the generator he knows he's putting his life at risk but believes he has what one could call a duty to protect others, one which puts the lives of the group above his. To me these serve as lessons, encouraging everyone to find the humanity, they have left, especially in extreme situations because that is what binds people togethers and allows humanity to live on. By helping someone else, we might lose in that instant, but in the grand scheme of things, we all prosper.

### Silence - A new form of expression
A Quiet Place: Day One boasts one of the most minimalist scripts I've ever encountered. In a world where silence reigns supreme, actions, music, and visuals take center stage as the primary forms of expression. I'm astonished at how masterfully the directors and actors have shaped and executed this concept. Alexis Grapsas's score brilliantly underscores the omnipresent tension, reinforcing the notion that danger lurks at every corner and the frequent scenes of creatures rushing through the streets, scaling buildings, and chasing after any sound amplify the horror, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat without a single word being spoken.  
However, I've had one issue with a scene related to this concept of silence. **Answer.** Why destroy the bridges if the creatures are attracted to noise and therefore will come back to the city?

### Staying in the present
Looking for what one has and not what one doesn't have
She dies at the end - talk about the search for pizza
Helping others gives purpose - not thinking only about yourself
